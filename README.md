# COVID_Deaths_Analysis
SQL analysis of COVID-19 data
# Data- the data was taken from www.ourworldindata.org. First the data was split into two different files so that I could demonstrate my ability to preform joins. This action was done in excel and then each sheet was saved. Both files have been uploaded in the repository. The SQL quries shown were done in BigQuery. The project also has comments describing the reasoning for preforming each query. These quries demonstrate my ability to navigate data in SQL. The code is contained in the SQL data explortation PDF.
